    <h1>Can't Help Falling Love</h1>
    <p>
        Wise men say only fools rush in <br />
        But I can't help falling in love with you<br />
        Shall I stay?<br />
        Would it be a sin<br />
        If I can't help falling in love with you?<br />
        <p>
            Like a river flows surely to the sea<br />
            Darling so it goes<br />
            Some things are meant to be<br />
            Take my hand, take my whole life too<br />
            For I can't help falling in love with you<br />
        </p>
